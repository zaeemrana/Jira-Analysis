# Jira-Analysis

Website Dashboard aimed at interfacing with Jira and proving Cornell University Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Project Team
to effectively analyze part status.

### Repository
This repository doesn't launch the website to the web and is simply a **mirror** of the one hosted on the CUAUV bitbucket account.
For more details, reach out to Zaeem Rana via zaeemrana@gmail.com.

### Features
* Time analysis of work by team member over the course of the year
* Calendar signup to coordinate creation of parts in the Emerson machine shop
* Status of parts currently on Jira
* Automated jira hour logger for repetitive predefined tasks

NOTE: Prediction of the required number of hours to manufacture a part using its name was simply for exploratory. Thus, the models and code used is not robust
